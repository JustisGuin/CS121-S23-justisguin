   //METHOD
    @Override
    // The @Override keyword is used in Java to indicate that a method declaration
    // is intended to override a method with the same signature in a superclass or interface.

    // When a method is marked with @Override, the compiler checks if the method exists in a superclass
    // or interface and if its signature matches. If the method is not found or the signature does not match, the compiler generates an error.

    // Using @Override is considered a good practice because it helps prevent errors in code maintenance
    // and improves readability. It also allows the compiler to provide additional checks,
    // such as detecting when a superclass method is renamed or removed.
